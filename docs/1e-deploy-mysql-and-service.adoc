### Deploy MySQL and Service
Duration: 4:00

MySQL uses persistent storage.  Rather than writing the data directly into the container image itself, our example stores the MySQL in a Google Compute Engine disk.  Before you can deploy the pod, you need to create a disk that can be mounted inside of the MySQL container:

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *gcloud compute disks create mysql-disk --size 200GB*
Created [...].
NAME        ZONE           SIZE_GB  TYPE         STATUS
mysql-disk  ...            200      pd-standard  READY
----

You can then deploy both the MySQL Pod and the Service with a single command:

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl create -f mysql-deployment.yaml -f mysql-service.yaml --record*
deployment "mysql" created
service "mysql" created
----

Lastly, you can see the pods and service status via the command line.  Recall the command you can use to see the status (hint: _kubectl get â€¦_).  Make sure the status is _Running_ before continuing.
