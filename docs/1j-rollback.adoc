### Rollback a Deployment
Duration: 10:00

You can see your deployment history:

[source,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl rollout history deployment frontend-ui*
deployments "frontend-ui":
REVISION CHANGE-CAUSE
1         <none>
2         kubectl edit deployment frontend-ui --record
----

Because when we edited the Deployment, we supplied the _--record_ argument, the Change Cause value is automatically recorded with the command line that was executed.

You can rollback a Deployment to a previous revision:

[source,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl rollout undo deployment frontend-ui*
deployment "frontend-ui" rolled back
----
