## Introduction
Duration: 5:00

Hello everyone, thanks for coming today! Ready to learn Kubernetes? You will first become familiar with Compute Engine before working through a example Guestbook application, and then move on to more advanced Kubernetes experiments.

Kubernetes is an open source project (available on link:http://kubernetes.io[]) which can run on many different environments, from laptops to high-availability multi-node clusters, from public clouds to on-premise deployments, from virtual machines to bare metal.

For the purpose of this codelab, using a managed environment such as Google Container Engine (a Google-hosted version of Kubernetes running on Compute Engine) will allow you to focus more on experiencing Kubernetes rather than setting up the underlying infrastructure but you should feel free to use your favorite environment instead.


.What is your experience level with Containers?
****
- I have just heard of Docker
- I played around with Docker
- I have containers in production
- I have already used container clustering technologies (kubernetes, mesos, swarm, ...)
