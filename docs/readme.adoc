## Kubernetes - The Basics

We’re going to work through this https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/kubernetes-lab[Guestbook] example. This example has a frontend using HTML5 and Javascript (client-side and server-side), and two microservices built using link:http://wildfly-swarm.io[WildFly Swarm] and link:http://vertx.io/[VertX]. It requires MySQL to store guestbook entries.

## Extra Credit
Duration: 10:00

Here are some ideas for next steps.

### Install Cloud SDK Command Line tool locally

To use _gcloud_ command line locally, you’ll need to install Cloud SDK.  Follow the link:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/#linux[Cloud SDK installation guide] for your platform.

### DIY Kubernetes cluster on Compute Engine

Download the open source version, build it and deploy a cluster yourself with the kubernetes tools.
Check out the link:http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/binary_release/#download-kubernetes-and-automatically-set-up-a-default-cluster[Kubernetes Getting Started] documentation. This can be as simple as running: _'curl -sS https://get.k8s.io | bash'_

.Codelab feedback
****
- The codelab was easy and useful
- The codelab was too complicated
- The codelab didn’t go far enough
- I had some technical difficulties
