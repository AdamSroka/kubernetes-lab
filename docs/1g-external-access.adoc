### Acessing the frontend
Duration: 5:00

When we deployed the frontend, we needed to specify that *the service needs to be externally accessible*. In Kubernetes, you can instruct the underlying infrastructure to create an external load balancer, by specifying the Service Type as a _LoadBalancer_.

You can see it in the frontend-service.yaml:

[source,yaml,subs="normal,attributes"]
----
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: frontend-service
  labels:
    app: frontend-service
    visualize: "true"
spec:
  *type: LoadBalancer*
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: http
  selector:
    app: frontend-ui
----

You can also access the public IP running, and look for LoadBalancer Ingress IPs in the output:

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl describe services frontend-service*
Name:                      frontend-service
Namespace:                  default
Labels:                     app=frontend-service,visualize=true
Selector:                   app=frontend-service
Type:                       LoadBalancer
IP:                         10.67.240.61
*LoadBalancer Ingress:       X.X.X.X*
Port:                       <unset> 80/TCP
NodePort:                   <unset> 31079/TCP
Endpoints:                  10.64.0.4:8080,10.64.3.4:8080
Session Affinity:           None
Events:
  FirstSeen LastSeen  Count  From                   Type       Reason                  Message
  --------- --------  -----  ----                   --------   ------                  -------
  9m         9m        1     {service-controller }   Normal    CreatingLoadBalancer    Creating load balancer
  8m         8m        1     {service-controller }   Normal    CreatedLoadBalancer     Created load balancer
----

NOTE: The external load balancer may take a minute or two to create.  Please retry the command above until the LoadBalancer Ingress shows up.

You can now access the guestbook via the ingress IP address by navigating the browser to _http://INGRESS_IP/_. 

You should see something like this:
