#### Optional interlude: Look at your pod running in a Docker container on the VM

Kubernetes is container format agnostic. In your lab, we are working with Docker containers. Keep in mind that Kubernetes work with other container formats too. You can see that the Docker container is running on one of the machines.  First, find the node name that Kubernetes scheduled this container to:

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *kubectl get pods -owide*
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       NODE
frontend-ui-...   1/1       Running   0          11m       gke-guestbook-...
frontend-ui-...   1/1       Running   0          11m       gke-guestbook-...
----

The value under the label NODE is the name of the node.

You can then SSH into that node: 

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *gcloud compute ssh <node-name>*
Warning: Permanently added '104.197.182.219' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
Linux gke-guestbook-default-pool-a27323b1-pzt9 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4 (2016-02-29) x86_64

Welcome to Kubernetes v1.2.4!

You can find documentation for Kubernetes at:
  http://docs.kubernetes.io/

You can download the build image for this release at:
  https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.2.4/kubernetes-src.tar.gz

It is based on the Kubernetes source at:
  https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/v1.2.4

someuser@<node-name>:~$
----

You can then use docker command line to see the running container:

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
someuser@<node-name>:~$ *sudo docker ps*
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                   COMMAND                 CREATED           STATUS            
52fb5e0aae73   rafabene/microservices-frontend:latest  "container-entrypoint"  14 minutes ago    Up 14 minutes     
....
someuser@<node-name>:~$ *exit*
logout
----

*End of Optional interlude: make sure you exit from the SSH* before you continue.

If you see other containers running donâ€™t worry, those are other services that are part of the management of Kubernetes clusters.
