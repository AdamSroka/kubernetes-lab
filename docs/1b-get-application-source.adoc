### Get the Guestbook source
Duration: 3:00

Start by cloning the github repository for the Guestbook application:

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/kubernetes-lab*
----

And move into the kubernetes examples directory.

[subs="normal,attributes"]
----
$ *cd kubernetes-lab/kubernetes*
----

We will be using the yaml files in this directory.  Every file describes a resource that needs to be deployed into Kubernetes. Without giving much detail on its contents, but you are definitely encouraged to read them and see how pods, services, and others are declared.  Weâ€™ll talk a couple of these files in detail.
