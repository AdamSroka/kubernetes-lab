## Setup environments
Duration: 15:00

This section describes what, how, and where to install the software needed for this lab. This lab is designed for a BYOL (Brying Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.

### Hardware

- Operating System: Windows 7 (SP1), Mac OS X (10.8 or later), Fedora (21 or later)
- Memory: At least 4 GB+, preferred 8 GB

### Software

#### Vagrant

Vagrant is a tool for building complete development environments. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases development/production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

Downloads are available from: link:https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[]

#### A virtualization platform (hypervisor) - VirtualBox

Vagrant needs a hypervisor to create a development environment. 

Downloads are available from link:https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[] .

[WARNING]
====
Linux Users:

. Have your kernel updated
. Users should have the GNU compiler, build and header files for your current Linux kernel
. Create a `/usr/src/linux` link to the current kernel source
====

#### CDK
